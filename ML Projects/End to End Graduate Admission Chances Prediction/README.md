**Context:** This dataset is created for prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective.

**Content:** The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The parameters included are:

- GRE Scores (out of 340)
- TOEFL Scores (out of 120)
- University Rating (out of 5)
- Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength (out of 5)
- Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)
- Research Experience (either 0 or 1)
- Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1)

**Acknowledgements:**
This dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset. The test scores and GPA are in the older format. The dataset is owned by Mohan S Acharya.

**Inspiration:**
This dataset was built with the purpose of helping students in shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their chances for a particular university.
